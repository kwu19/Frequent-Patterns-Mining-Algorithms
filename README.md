### Dataset:
The dataset that this project uses is the UCI Adult Census Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). This dataset contains 32562 adultsâ€™ information and 15 attributes for each adult. The attributes are stated as follows: 1. Age 2. Workclass 3. Fnlwgt 4. Education 5. Education-num 6. Marital-status 7. Occupation 8. Relationship 9. Race 10. Sex 11. Capital-gain 12. Capital-loss 13. Hours-per-week 14. Native-country 15. Salary.

### Assumptions:
1. In this dataset, there are a lot of zeros in different attributes. Therefore, one assumption based on this dataset is that all zeros are no different from each other. In other words, attributes that contain zero are assumed to be the same.
2. Minimum support is assumed to be 0.23 and minimum confidence is assumed to be 0.7.
3. This project is written in Python 3.

### Task:
1. Implement Apriori Algorithm
2. Improve Apriori Algorithm
3. Implement FP-Growth Algorithm
